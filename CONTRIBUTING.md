# Contributing to Nessie
## How to contribute
Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the Nessie project. We welcome of course code changes,
but we are also grateful for bug reports, feature suggestions, helping with testing and
documentation, or simply spreading the word about Nessie.

There are several ways to get in touch with other contributors:
 * Slack: get an invite to the channel by emailing slack-subscribe@projectnessie.org
 * Google Groups: You can join the discussion at https://groups.google.com/g/projectnessie

More information are available at https://projectnessie.org/develop/

## Code of conduct
You must agree to abide by the Project Nessie [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting issues
Issues can be filed on GitHub. Please use the template and add as much detail as possible. Including the
version of the client and server, how the server is being run (eg docker image) etc. The more the community
knows the more it can help :-)

### Feature Requests

If you have a feature request or questions about the direction of the project please join the slack channel
and ask there. It helps build a richer discussion and more people can be involved than when posting as an issue.

### Large changes or improvements

We are excited to accept new contributors and larger changes. Please join the mailing list and post a proposal
before submitting a large change. This helps avoid double work and allows the community to arrive at a consensus
on the new feature or improvement.

## Code changes

### Development process

The development process doesn't contain many surprises. As most projects on github anyone can contribute by
forking the repo and posting a pull request. See
[GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
for more information. Small changes don't require an issue. However, it is good practice to open up an issue for
larger changes. If you are unsure of where to start ask on the slack channel or look at [existing issues](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/issues).
The [good first issue](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label marks issues that are particularly good for people new to the codebase.

### Style guide

Changes must adhere to the style guide and this will be verified by the continuous integration build.
Python code adheres to the pep8 standard.

### Submitting a pull request

Upon submission of a pull request you will be asked to sign our contributor license agreement. We use [Reviewable.io](https://reviewable.io/) for reviews.
Anyone can take part in the review process and once the community is happy and the build actions are passing a Pull Request will be merged. Support
must be unanimous for a change to be merged.
