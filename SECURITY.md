# Security Policy

This repository contains demos and code to support the demos, to remove as much of the boilerplate code
as possible within the demos.

Some demos may use older versions of for example [Nessie](https://projectnessie.org), older versions of
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and other libraries.

## Supported Versions

For a list of supported Nessie versions, see [Nessie's SECURITY.md file](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

For a list of supported Spark versions, consult the official [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) website.

All references to Nessie demos should refer to the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any security issues should be reported to security@projectnessie.org, please refrain from posting publicly until the team can investigate and patch the code.
