# Special configuration to run a Nessie Demo against Nessie and/or Iceberg built locally from source.
#
# Requires four environment variables:
#
# NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_NESSIE_RUNNER : the path of the Nessie runner, usually the Nessie Quarkus Runner native image
# NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_NESSIE_VERSION : the Nessie version, usually a SNAPSHOT version
# NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_PYNESSIE_PATH : the path to the pynessie Wheel in the nessie/python/dist directory, built with e.g. `python -m build`"
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Setup projectnessie/nessie
# 1.1. Build Nessie w/ native image:
#      `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Pnative`
# 1.2. Get Nessie version
#      `./mvnw help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout`
# 1.3. Build pynessie
#      Run `python -m build` in a virtualenv in the Nessie source tree within the `python/` directory
# 2. Setup Apache Iceberg
# 2.1. Build Iceberg, publish to local maven repo
#      `./gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal`
# 2.2. Identify the version
#      Lookup the version number from a built jar - e.g. in `nessie/build/libs/`
# 3. Set environment variables:
#    NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_NESSIE_RUNNER to the full path within the Nessie source tree in servers/quarkus/target/...
#    NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_NESSIE_VERSION to the version from step 1.2
#    NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_ICEBERG_VERSION to the version from step 2.2
#    NESSIE_DEMO_IN_DEV_PYNESSIE_PATH to the `.whl` file within the Nessie source tree in `python/dist/`
